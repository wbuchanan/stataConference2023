# Metaprogramming: What it is, how to use it, and why you should care
Metaprogramming provides a highly flexible approach to solving complex programming problems. 
Although metaprogramming can be challenging to implement in some programming languages, metaprogramming 
is easy to implement in Stata largely because of the evaluation of local macros. However, metaprogramming 
is rarely discussed in the Stata community despite the benefits that metaprogramming can and does provide 
for many Stata users already. This talk will include a discussion of what metaprogramming is and how 
metaprogramming can be used effectively to increase efficiency and will illustrate the use of 
metaprogramming in Stata.

## Examples
Code examples are embedded in the slides and some examples, and output, are included here. Following the presentation, 
I will add some additional slides that I am excluding from the talk to stay within the time allotted.  

## Easter Eggs
I had removed a couple of slides prior to the talk for timing purposes.  These slides are now available which show another
couple of examples of using metaprogramming in different ways.
